# Drugs Side Effects & Medical Condition Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing drugs, their reported side effects, and associated medical conditions.
The goal is to uncover patterns in drug usage, identify commonly occurring side effects, and build
machine learning models to predict potential side effects based on drug characteristics.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical companies need data-driven insights to understand
drug safety, side-effect severity, and patient risk factors to improve treatment outcomes.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning (Classification Models)
- Tableau Dashboards

## 📊 Key Objectives
- Analyze frequency and severity of drug side effects
- Identify drugs with high-risk adverse reactions
- Build predictive models for side-effect occurrence
- Visualize insights using Tableau dashboards
